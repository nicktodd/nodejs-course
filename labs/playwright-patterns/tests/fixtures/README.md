# Test Image File

This is a placeholder for a test image file. 

For the lab, you'll need to create a small JPG image file named `test-image.jpg` in this folder.
You can use any image, but it should be relatively small (less than 1MB) for testing purposes.

When running tests that upload images, the test will look for this file as a fixture to use
for image upload testing.

# Basic JavaScript Lab

## Objectives
- Practice using JavaScript variables and data types
- Work with JavaScript operators
- Create and run a simple JavaScript application
- Practice debugging using console.log

## Exercise 1: Temperature Converter
Create a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

### Requirements:
1. Create variables for storing temperatures
2. Implement both Fahrenheit to Celsius and Celsius to Fahrenheit conversions
3. Use proper variable naming conventions
4. Use template literals for output
5. Display results with 2 decimal places

### Formula:
- Celsius to Fahrenheit: (C × 9/5) + 32
- Fahrenheit to Celsius: (F - 32) × 5/9

### Expected Output:
```
Temperature Converter
--------------------
32°F is 0.00°C
0°C is 32.00°F
98.6°F is 37.00°C
37°C is 98.60°F
```

## Exercise 2: Simple Calculator
Create a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

### Requirements:
1. Create variables for two numbers
2. Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
3. Use appropriate operators
4. Handle division by zero
5. Format output clearly

### Expected Output:
```
Calculator Results
----------------
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2
10 / 0 = Cannot divide by zero
```

## Bonus Challenge
Add input validation to ensure numbers are within a reasonable range (e.g., between -1000 and 1000).

## Tips
- Test your code with different values
- Use console.log() for debugging
- Pay attention to code formatting and organization
- Comment your code to explain what it does

## Getting Started
1. Create a new file called temperature.js for Exercise 1
2. Create a new file called calculator.js for Exercise 2
3. Run your code using Node.js: `node filename.js`

# Turbopack Demo

This is a minimal demo project using Turbopack.

## What it does
- Bundles `index.js` into `dist/bundle.js`.
- The HTML file loads the bundle and logs a message to the console.

## How to run
1. Install Turbopack (if available):
   ```sh
   npm install @turbo/pack --save-dev
   ```
2. Build the project (refer to Turbopack docs for exact commands):
   ```sh
   # Example (may vary)
   npx turbo build
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser and check the console for the message.

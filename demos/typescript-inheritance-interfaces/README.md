# TypeScript Inheritance and Interfaces Demo

This folder contains demonstration code for:
- Inheritance
- Defining interfaces for methods and properties
- Discriminated unions
- Additional interface techniques

Each concept is illustrated in a separate TypeScript file for clarity.

## Files
- `inheritance.ts` — Class inheritance, abstract classes, protected members, instanceof/type-casting
- `interface-methods.ts` — Interfaces specifying methods, implemented by object literals and classes
- `interface-properties.ts` — Interfaces specifying properties, implemented by object literals and classes
- `discriminated-union.ts` — Discriminated union types for flexible object shapes
- `interface-techniques.ts` — Extending interfaces, function signatures, array types, and interface augmentation

Run any file with:
```bash
npx ts-node <filename>
```

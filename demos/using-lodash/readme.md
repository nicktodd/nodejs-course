To run the Typescript file, you can use the following command:

```
npx ts-node src/using-lodash.ts
```

This works because the following library has been installed:

```
npm install ts-node typescript --save-dev
```

You can also run it using:

 ```
 npm start
```

Since the package.json file has the folders configured.

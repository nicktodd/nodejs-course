# TypeScript Classes - Solution

This directory contains the solution to the TypeScript Classes lab exercise.

To run the solution:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The solution demonstrates creating an Account class with proper properties, methods, and a working implementation of deposits, withdrawals, and interest calculation.

## Lab Series
This solution is part 1 of a two-part lab series:
1. **TypeScript Classes** (current) - Focuses on creating a basic Account class
2. **TypeScript Inheritance and Interfaces** - Extends the Account class with inheritance and interfaces

The Account class created in this lab serves as the foundation for the follow-up lab on inheritance and interfaces.
